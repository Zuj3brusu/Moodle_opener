# Moodle_opener
Moodle opener to painlessly open the badly designed website XD

Pre-reqs:
1. Python 2.7
2. Selenium
3. Chromedriver (added to PATH)
4. Google Chrome

You can edit the username and password according to your choice.

Can be easily modified to download files from moodle to any folder and also to submit assignments on time ;)
